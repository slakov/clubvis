# clubviz

Visualizer for the club distribution problem.

## Run in development mode

You need nodejs and npm installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
cd <repo-dir>
npx live-server
```

This will start a http server on port 8080 on localhost which you can point your browser to.
`live-server` will reload whenever a file inside `repo-dir` or its subdirs is changed.
